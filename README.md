# Faster-Fire-Red
A Patch for Fire Red (Rev 1) that adds quality of life improvements for playing IronMON

* You must talk to Mom to start your adventure, but don't worry, she has something to show you
* The Oak Parcel quest is shortened by having the Mart Employee and Oak meet you part way
* Repel's will prompt you to use another one when your current one wears off
* TM's are Gold instead of Red
* Pokemon Renamers have been added to all PokeCenters
* Instant PC (very short animation for healing at the PokeCenter)
* Step Items in the Underground Pass and Sevii Islands are now guaranteed to spawn. This does not work with the Mt. Moon items.
* The PC Item is now in the lab instead of in the PC, allowing people to savestate in the lab and still have the PC item
* Bill no longer asks you to go to Sevii after beating Blaine but he is still located in the Cinnabar Island PokeCenter
* An NPC was modified in Viridian to give you a Friendship boost to a single Pokemon. Please note that this is against the spirit of the challenge and should only be used if you're fully aware of this. This can only be used once per run.
